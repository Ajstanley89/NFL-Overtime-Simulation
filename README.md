# NFL Overtime Simulation

Historically, the NFL has used "sudden death" rules in playoff overtime (first score wins). As such, it was extremely advantageous to possess the ball first in overtime. A simple field goal could win the game without ever letting the opponent get the ball.

In 2024, the playoff [rules](https://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/nfl-overtime-rules/) were changed to allow each team a possession at the start of overtime. If the score is tied after each team's initial posession, then the next score wins. Under these new rules, it's unclear if it's better to get the ball first or second. If you get the ball first, you get the ball again if the score is tied after the initial posessions and can win the game without the opponent going back on offense. If you get the ball second, you have more information on your drive and can use 4th downs more effectively. This is a simple Monte Carlo simulation to see if either strategy is more advantageous.
